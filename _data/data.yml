career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a population geneticist working with a wide range of model systems. I use genomic data from modern and historical organisms with state-of-art computational methods to investigate questions about population histories, local adaptation, selection and allele frequencies through time, among others.

    info:
      - role: Research fellow
        time: 2021 - Present
        company: University College London, UK
        details: |
          As a research fellow, I have led a global genomic surveillance project focused on the wheat-blast fungus, *Magnaporthe oryzae*. I have conducted a thorough analysis of genome-wide variables to identify signatures of local adaptation and positive selection in the rice-infecting lineage of the blast fungus. Additionally, my contributions have enabled a deeper understanding of the maintenance of diversity over time in pathogenic lineages of plant-infecting bacteria within the *Pseudomonas* sp. - *Arabidopsis thaliana* pathosystem.
      - role: PhD Researcher
        time: 2016 - 2020
        company: Max Planck Institute for Biology, Germany
        details: |
          During my PhD, I specialized in the application of ancient and historical DNA to reconstruct phylogenomic relationships and infer population history. My research encompassed diverse model systems, including microorganisms such as *M. oryzae*, plants like *A. thaliana*, and scarab beetles of the genus *Oryctes*. By employing genomic methods and computational analyses, I sought to uncover novel insights into the evolutionary processes that shaped the genetic diversity of these organisms.
